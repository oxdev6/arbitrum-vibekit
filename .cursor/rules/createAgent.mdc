# Architecture

- An agent must always use MCP tools to interact with external services or perform actions.
- MCP servers may be connected to remotely via SSE/Websocket pointing to a URL, or locally via STDIO pointing to a file within `typescript/lib/mcp-tools/`.
- New MCP tools must be added to or created as an MCP server within `typescript/lib/mcp-tools/`
- An agent is always served as an MCP server itself.

# Packages

- Always use default packages unless directed otherwise.
