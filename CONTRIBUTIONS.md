## Contributing to Vibekit

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Vibetkit! This guide explains how to make valuable contributions to the project.

## Getting Started

Before you start your work, checkout [open issues](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/issues) to see if someone is already working on the same topic. For big changes or new features, create an issue first to avoid duplicate work, though it’s not required for smaller updates.

## Development Steps

**1. Fork the Repository:** Start by creating your own copy of the repository.

**2. Review MCP Tools Guidelines:** Checkout the [README.md](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/lib/mcp-tools) file in the `mcp-tools` directory for guidance on developing MCP tools.

**3. Implement Changes:** Add new tools or improve existing ones.

**4. Create Documentation:** Create a `README` file for your new MCP tool that clearly explains its functionality and setup process.

**5. Create Example Agents:** Consider adding a demo agent to the [examples directory](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/examples) to showcase your new features.

**6. Update CHANGELOG:** Document your modifications in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to keep the project’s history clear.
