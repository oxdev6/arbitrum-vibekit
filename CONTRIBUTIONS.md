# Contributing to Agentkit

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Agentkit! This guide explains how you can make valuable contributions to the project.

## 1. Preliminary Steps

- **Open an Issue (Optional):** For major changes or feature requests, consider creating an issue first. This step is not required for minor updates but helps avoid duplicate efforts.
- **Check Existing Issues:** Before starting your work, review open issues to see if the topic has already been addressed.

## 2. Development Guidelines

To contribute effectively:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Begin by creating your own copy of the repository.
2. **Review mcp-tools README:** Consult the `README.md` in `mcp-tools` for guidance on developing MCP tools.
3. **Implement Changes:** Add new tools or enhance existing ones.
4. **Create Example Agents:** Consider contributing example agents that demonstrate your new functionality.
5. **Update Documentation:** Document your modifications in the `CHANGELOG.md` to keep the project’s history transparent.
6. **Document Required Environment Variables:** If your changes require new or updated environment variables, add clear setup instructions so others can replicate your environment.
7. **Provide Thorough Error Handling:** Include clear mechanisms for detecting and reporting errors in any newly introduced features or tools.

## 3. Submitting Your Work

When preparing your pull request (PR):

- **Reference Related Issues:** Link any relevant issues to provide context.
- **Pass Continuous Integration Checks:** Make sure your code meets all testing and linting requirements.
- **Provide Clear Documentation:** Include concise explanations of your changes and any necessary usage details.

## 4. Review Process

- **Merging:** Once all feedback is addressed and the PR is approved, your contribution will be merged.
