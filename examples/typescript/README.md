Here you will find example agent implementations of the tools available through the Arbitrum Agentkit.
These agents may also be used as MCP-tools for other agents, a pattern observed on much high-visibility literature.
This will also enable the agents to be listed on MCP registries in the upcoming months, as part of the Agentkit-agent creation process.
