Get started building Arbitrum Agents in Typescript.

## Introduction

AgentKit is a toolkit to enable agent developers to build onchain agents in minutes. 

Powered by the Arbitrum ecosystem, it allows agents to autonomously perform any on-chain interaction, including transfers, swaps, and advanced DeFi interactions, leveraged alongside on-chain and off-chain data for powerful workflows. 

It is a collection of implementations across different sectors and providers, with a growing list of examples and templates for your benefit.
