## üéõÔ∏è Agent Playground

The `examples` directory contains ready-to-roll DeFi agents built with the Vibekit. These agents showcase how to deploy smart, autonomous on-chain agents in a few steps. Each agent doubles as an MCP tool, enabling agent-to-agent integration for powerful workflows.

Want to vibe code your own custom agent? Jump to [Building Your Own Agent](#-building-your-own-agent) to get started.

### üöÄ Running an Existing Agent

#### 1. Setup Environment

Navigate to the desired agent's directory and create an `.env` file. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into the `.env` file and fill in any required secrets or configuration variables.

#### 2. Start the Agent

There are three main ways to start an agent:

**1. Cursor's AI Assistant (Vibe Coding)**:
Ask Cursor's integrated AI assistant to run your desired agent.

**2. Docker Compose**:

Navigate to the `typescript` directory and install the necessary packages.

```
cd typescript
pnpm install
```

Next, run the MCP-enabled Docker container to start your agent. Replace the `"agent-name"` with the name of your desired agent, for example: `"swapping-agent-no-wallet"`.

```
pnpm --filter "agent-name" docker:compose:up
```

**Note**: If you get a `permission denied error`, try running the above command with `sudo`:

```
sudo pnpm --filter "agent-name" docker:compose:up
```

**Running on background**: To run the agent in the background so you can keep using your terminal, use the `-d` flag:

```
pnpm --filter "agent-name" docker:compose:up -d
```

To stop the agent afterwards, use the following command:

```
pnpm --filter "agent-name" docker:compose:down
```

**3. Local Development**:

Navigate to the `typescript` directory and run the following `pnpm` commands to build
your agent. Replace the `"agent-name"` with the name of your desired agent, for example: `"swapping-agent-no-wallet"`.

```
cd typescript
pnpm install

pnpm --filter "agent-name" install
pnpm --filter "agent-name" build
pnpm --filter "agent-name" dev
```

#### 3. Interact with the Agent

Once the agent is up and running on port 3001, you have two ways to engage with it:

- **Launch the Inspector interface:**

Open a new terminal window and run the following to start the inspector:

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:6274 in your browser to access the interface and click on "Connect" to establish a connection with your local server:

  <img src="../../img/inspector_1.png" width="700px" alt="Inspector1"/>
</p>

Next, click on "List Tools" to view and run the tools your agent offers:

<p align="left">
  <img src="../../img/inspector_2.png" width="700px" alt="Inspector2"/>
</p>

The Inspector interface provides a straightforward way to interact with your agent. For a more integrated development experience, you can use the Cursor IDE.

- **Integrate with Cursor IDE**

To interact with the agent though Cursor, [create or update](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) your `mcp.json` file through Cursor settings with the following content:

```
{
 "mcpServers": {
   "local-sse-agent": {
     "url": "http://localhost:3001/sse"
   }
 }
}

```

Restart Cursor to apply the new configuration. Upon successful integration, Cursor will automatically detect the Agent MCP tool and you can interact with it directly through prompts.

**Note:** This configuration approach is also compatible with other graphical MCP clients like [Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) and [Windsurf](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/mcp). Simply adjust the settings accordingly in their respective configuration files.
